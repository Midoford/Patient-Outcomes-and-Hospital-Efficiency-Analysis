## Patient Report
**Project Objectives:**

- **Predict 30-Day Readmission Risk**:Develop a machine learning model to identify patients at high risk of readmission within 30 days, enabling proactive interventions.
- **Reduce Preventable Readmissions** [Patient Visual Report]( https://github.com/Midoford/Patient-Outcomes-and-Hospital-Efficiency-Analysis/blob/main/Execise.pbix): Use predictive insights to optimize resource allocation and implement strategies that lower preventable readmissions, improving patient outcomes and reducing costs.

**Purpose of Patients Analytics:**
- **Improve Clinical Decision-Making**: Use predictive analytics to identify high-risk patients, enabling personalized care plans and reducing readmissions.
- **Enhance Operational Efficiency**: Minimize preventable readmissions to optimize resources, reduce costs, and align with value-based care goals.

**Importance of Analyzing Sales Data:**
**1.** **Enhancing Patient Care:** Predicting readmissions helps improve patient outcomes, reduce adverse events, and build trust through better care planning and follow-up.
**2.** **Boosting Financial Performance:** Predicting readmissions helps improve patient outcomes, reduce adverse events, and build trust through better care planning and follow-up.
